			<h1>Our Products</h1>
			<p>
				We have a vast selection of the most expensive and useless pet products you could possibly want. We will not match any price, so don't even think about it. We are not responsible for the occasional snake that bursts into flames, or the rats that grow to 150 lbs. That was the other pet shop. No matter what that guy says, we are not related.
